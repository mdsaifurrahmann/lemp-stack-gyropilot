# # Lemp Stack Gyro Pilot
LEMP Stack Gyro pilot is a shell script. This Script will install all the programs of LEMP Stack Development automatically on your debian or ubuntu based linux distro. It's super easy to use.

> *Unfortunately this script is only for debian or ubuntu based distro's. I'm not so much familier with Arch, openSUSE or Fedora yet. So I can't make this script for them. But if any one of them who know bash scripting and use Arch/OpenSUSE/Fedora, they're mostly welcome to contribute on this repository. I'll be thankful and willing to give credit to them.*

# How to Use?
Just copy this command and paste it in your terminal then hit enter to initiate.
That's all. Now you just need to chill!

For Debian/Ubuntu based distro:

```
>If you face any problem to use this command then please let me know. I'll help you if there any unknown error appeared!
